/*
What is this?
This is a recurring, non-ranked, ~month long game jam. It's nice to be held accountable when making a small game. One to two week jams can be too much of a time crunch for some, but a month is a bit more comfortable.

Who is this for?
Anyone ðŸ™‚! 1st game or 100th, this game jam is here to help you if you need this accountability. If you don't finish your project during the month, no worries! We've all been there.

Requirements
After the game jam is over, take a look at the entries and provide feedback! Tell them what you liked about playing and what could use work. Err on the side of saying things in a kind way: "Something I think could use some work/something I had trouble with while playing is..." is better than "I didn't like/this game is bad because..."

### Scope:
I want to make a simple game that helps me learn more python programming. I intend to start with PyGame and move onward from there.
